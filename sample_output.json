I've been trying to get this resolved for over a week now and nobody seems to be able to help me. I understand you're frustrated Sandra. Let me look into your account. Can you provide me with your order number? Yes, it's #12345. I've already given this to three other agents and nothing has been done. I see the order here. It looks like there was a shipping delay. Well that's not good enough! I need this resolved today or I want to speak to your manager. I'm not authorized to do that right now. Let me see what other options we have. This is ridiculous! I've been a customer for 5 years and this is how you treat me?",
